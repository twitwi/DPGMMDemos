DP-GMM Demos
============

This project is a sharing of some experiments I made on implementing DP-GMM.

* DP: Dirichlet Process (i.e., a model for infinite mixtures)
* GMM: Gaussian Mixture Models
* implementing: using a Gibbs sampler (for now)
* experiments: pure Java, OpenCL, varying priors, â€¦
